When I compiled the code as is, at first the salaries were the same.
After I added the word virtual before Payment in the base class, the salaries printed out were different.
This result was what we expected and wanted.
However, to do this, we needed to be able to redefine the member of the base class in a derived class. To do this, we had to make it virtual.
