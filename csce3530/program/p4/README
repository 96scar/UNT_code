Added the following requirements to program 3 to create program 4.
"The client should be able to transfer a text file to the server. 
The file name is passed as an argument to the client program along with the port number. 
Also, the transferred file has to be written on to a file on the server side."


To compile: 
gcc server.c -o pserver
gcc client.c -o pclient

To execute:
./pserver <portnumber>
./pclient <portnumber> <filename>

To test: 
Look at the output on the screens or in the server.out and client.out files.
Compare the sent and received data. Make sure the data is correct.
Make sure to delete client.out and server.out each time you rerun the code. 
The files will be created if they don't exist, but will be appended to if they do exist.
Open the file copy.txt to see that the server copied the file from the file opened correctly.

Below is an in depth description:
First run the server.c file on the cse01 machine.
Then run the client.c file on the cse02 machine.
Each of these must have 2 arguments to main to work. The first is the executable name and the second is the port number.
The port number must match on both in order to connect the server and client. They communicate over the port with sockets.
This port number is used to fill in the tcp segment source and destination fields on both the client and the server.
The header length is only going to be 20 bytes because there are no options set. There are 5 32bit words, so the header length is 5. 
In order to set the header length, represent it as binary value 0101. Then put that at the beginning of the 16bit tcp segment header flags field.
The header flags field is set with the hexadecimal value.

To make initial sequence numbers random, I added a random number generator on both the client and server. 
The random number is picked to be between 0 and 100.

There are two unsigned short int arrays in both files that are used to send and receive data between client and server.
The cksum_arr[12] gets turned into a string seperated by spaces.
The string that is received gets turned into the rec_arr[12] by tokenizing by spaces.

I open each of the output files in append mode to be able to print the segments sent and received to them.
I also print the same information to the screen at the same time.

The cksum_arr is filled up with the data from the tcp_segment that is set.

CLIENT ONE
The client sends a connection request to the server.
The sequence number is random. 
The ack number is 0. 
The hdr_flags is 0101 0000 0000 0010 -> 0x5002. (header is 5 and SYN bit is 1)
The rest is initially set to 0.
The cksum_arr is filled with the tcp_seg data.
The checksum is computed. (this part was provided by Dr. Robin)
The checksum value gets set in the tcp segment.
The cksum_arr is refilled with the new tcp segment data.
I print the cksum_arr to the screen and client.out.
The cksum_arr is printed to a string, separated by spaces.
The client writes this string to the socket.

SERVER ONE
Server receives client's connection request.
The server reads a string from the socket.
I tokenized the string spaces and set the values in the string to the rec_arr.
I print the rec_arr to the screen and server.out.

SERVER TWO
Server sends connection granted response.
The sequence number is random. 
The ack number is rec_arr[2] + 1 (initial client sequence number + 1).
The hdr_flags is 0101 0000 0001 0010 -> 0x5012. (header is 5 and SYN bit is 1 and ACK bit is 1)
The rest is zero.
The cksum_arr is filled with the tcp_seg data.
The checksum is computed.
The checksum value is put into the tcp segment.
The cksum_arr is refilled with the new tcp segment data.
I print the cksum_arr to the screen and server.out.
The cksum_arr is printed to a string, separated by spaces.
The server writes this string to the socket.

CLIENT TWO
The client receives the server's connection granted response.
The client reads a string from the socket.
I tokenized the string spaces and set the values in the string to the rec_arr.
I print rec_arr to the screen and client.out.

CLIENT THREE
The client sends acknowledgment to server.
The sequence number is set to cksum_arr[2] + 1 (initial client sequence number + 1).
The ack number is set to rec_arr[2] + 1 (initial server sequence number + 1).
The hdr_flags is 0101 0000 0001 0000 -> 0x5010. (header is 5 and ACK bit is 1)
The rest is set to 0.
The cksum_arr is filled with the tcp_seg data.
The checksum is computed.
The checksum value is put into the tcp segment.
The cksum_arr is refilled witht the new tcp_seg data.
I print the cksum_arr to the screen and the client.out file.
I print the cksum_arr to a string separated by spaces.
I write the string to the socket.

SERVER THREE
Server recieves acknowledgment from client.
The server reads a string from the socket.
I tokenized the string spaces and set the values in the string to the rec_arr.
I print rec_arr to the screen and server.out.


This is where I send the data from the client to the server.
The client writes to the server 8 times because the file is 1024 bytes and i send 128 bytes at a time.
The server puts this data into a file.



CLIENT FOUR
Client sends close request to server.
The initial sequence number is random.
The initial ack number is 0.
The hdr_flags is 0101 0000 0000 0001 -> 0x5001. (header is 5 and FIN bit is 1)
The rest is set to 0.
The cksum_arr is filled with the tcp_seg data.
The checksum is calculated.
The cksum_arr is refilled with the new tcp_seg data.
I print out the cksum_arr to the screen and client.out.
I print the cksum_arr to a string separated by spaces.
