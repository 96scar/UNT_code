Program 1 -- READ_ME file

There are two files needed to start running this program.
serverA.c needs to be ran on cse01 machine first, with the port number in the second command line argument.
client.c needs to be ran on cse02 machine second, with the port number in the second command line argument.
Then enter the website on the client on cse02 machine.
The server recieves the website from the client.
The server then creates the get request text by echoing it and redirecting the input to a file.
The server pipes the request file into netcat of the website. This asks the webserver for the HTML file of the website.
The server saves this HTML file into a text file.
The server opens this HTML file and puts it into a buffer.
The server sends this buffer to the client.
The client reads this buffer text from the server.
The client opens a new file of its own to put this buffer text into.

Sometimes, the program has a segmentation fault, probably when the website is really big and the buffer or file can't hold that much data.
