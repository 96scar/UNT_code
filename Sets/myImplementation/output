Checking set sets[1]
{0, 27, 109}
Checking set sets[2]
{27, 34, 43}
Checking set sets[3] before intersection
{}
Performing sets[3] = sets[1] & sets[2] 
{27}
The intersection of sets[1] and sets[2] is 
{27}
Checking set sets[3] before union
Performing sets[3] = sets[1] | sets[2] 

The union of sets[1] and sets[2] is 
{0, 27, 34, 43, 109}
About to test cardinality

The cardinality of S3 = 5
